# Betsson.gr Homepage Clone

## Project Overview

This is a personal project where I developed a React application to clone the [Betsson.gr](https://betsson.gr) homepage. The purpose of this project is to keep my skills fresh and my mind sharp by practicing modern front-end development techniques and libraries.

## Features

- **UI Components:** Utilized various components from the [Material UI library](https://mui.com/) to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
- **HTTP Requests:** Implemented RESTful API calls using the [Axios HTTP client](https://github.com/axios/axios) to fetch dummy data for practicing asynchronous data fetching and state management in React.
- **Custom Hooks:** Developed a custom `useFetch` hook to handle data fetching in a reusable manner across different components.
